## 🎯 Organization Tips

### Homeworks
- Create weekly folders: `week-01/`, `week-02/`, etc.
- Include Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, and data files

- Include code snippets and examples

### Projects
- Separate folders for midterm and capstone projects
- Include data, notebooks, models, and documentation
- Follow project structure guidelines from the course

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Follow the ML Zoomcamp course schedule
2. Create folders as needed for each week
3. Document your learning journey
4. Share and collaborate with other participants

## 💡 Alternative Recommendation

**Consider creating a dedicated ML Zoomcamp repository instead!**

This approach provides:
- Better focus on ML content
- Cleaner portfolio presentation
- Easier collaboration with peers
- Separate version control for different learning domains
